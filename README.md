# The Parables of Jesus
This is a six-week, video-based class on the parables of Jesus.  It is designed to be used by small groups, whether they meet at church or in home. The *purpose* of this class is not for me to teach you what these parables mean.  The *purpose* is teach you how to interpret and apply parables for youself.

There are actually seven videos in this class:

* This is an [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJnlcwlPsiM&index=2&t=0s&list=PL4bBxNW7CYAOco9qD_-bDvQMdsLxzBSQi) that should be watched by everyone in the group *before* attending the first week's session. Pay particular attention to recommended resources; you *should* acquire all of them before watching the first video.
