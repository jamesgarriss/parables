# The Parables of Jesus
This is a six-week, video-based class on the parables of Jesus.  It is designed to be used by small groups, whether they meet at church or in home. The *purpose* of this class is not for me to teach you what these parables mean.  The *purpose* is teach you how to interpret and apply parables for youself.

There are actually seven videos in this class:

* The class begins with an [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJnlcwlPsiM&index=2&t=0s&list=PL4bBxNW7CYAOco9qD_-bDvQMdsLxzBSQi) that should be watched individually by everyone *before* attending the week one session. Pay particular attention to recommended resources; the group *should* acquire all of them before coming together to start week one.
* Week One - This video teaches you [how to interpret parables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9ir3MbwCRs&index=3&t=0s&list=PL4bBxNW7CYAOco9qD_-bDvQMdsLxzBSQi).  The format of this video is a lecture, where I help you to understand what a parable is, how to interpret it, and how to apply it.  It would be a good idea to take some notes while listening.
* Week Two - This video uses the [parable of the great banquet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVRt6_BsLxk&index=4&t=0s&list=PL4bBxNW7CYAOco9qD_-bDvQMdsLxzBSQi) to provide an example on how to interpret parables. It demonstrates the principles that were taught in the week one video.
* Week Three - This video uses the [parable of the lost son] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMpD0BTMHA&index=5&t=0s&list=PL4bBxNW7CYAOco9qD_-bDvQMdsLxzBSQi) to allow you to put into practice what you've learned. In it we go back and forth asking and answering questions.  Make sure that you have all of the recommended resources for this week.
* Week Four - This video uses the [parable of the unrighteous administrator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egRXJ3f6M2I&index=6&t=0s&list=PL4bBxNW7CYAOco9qD_-bDvQMdsLxzBSQi).  It's format is the same as week three.
* Week Five - This video uses the [parable of the good Samaritan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9IekhjC3RU&index=7&t=0s&list=PL4bBxNW7CYAOco9qD_-bDvQMdsLxzBSQi) to allow you to contineu putting into practice what you've learned.  In it I allow you to answer all the questions before we go over any of the answers.
* Week Six - This video uses the [parable of the rich fool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11iPXoHf7Gk&index=8&t=0s&list=PL4bBxNW7CYAOco9qD_-bDvQMdsLxzBSQi). It's format is the same as week five.
